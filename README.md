## Demo

In Wordle, users have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. You're helped along the way by ruling out letters that aren't in the word, and being told whether the correct letters are in the correct location or not.

## Getting Started

This project is created with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), a modern JS build tool. It's intended to be run locally, on your computer, using Node.js and NPM.

To run a local development server, we first need to install third-party dependencies (eg. React, Parcel). This can be done by cd-ing into the root project folder and running the following command:

```
$ npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been downloaded, you can run a dev server with the following command:

```
$ npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server.
